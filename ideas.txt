Don't control with swipes, have markers at decision points and control like you're unlocking an android phone

Find all nodes one hop away, and all nodes one or two spaces away from those one hop nodes. Note that one hop nodes can only be on the same x or y as the start node. Maybe bias towards correct if we're close?

If we cross a line, find the closest node on the pre-cross side of the line

OR

Control like PacMan on Android

Runner has a field controlling what direction the controller is pointing
It automatically controls what x and y we're at, takes in a stepTime argument on creation
Has a function to give the percentage between spaces (how far through a step we're at)
